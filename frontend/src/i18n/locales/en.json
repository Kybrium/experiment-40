We aim to recreate human civilization from its very beginnings under realistic conditions to explore how various social, political, and individual traits shape the environment and influence development. Experiment-40 serves as a platform for researchers, sociologists, political scientists, and curious minds to test their ideas in a simulated society. Project administrators will not interfere with experiments unless a technical necessity arises. If you want to be part of this endeavor, register and join our server to begin your journey.",
